### Problem Statement

You are given a sequence $A = (A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N)$ of length $N$ and a positive integer $K$ (at most $N$).  
For each $i = 1, 2, \dots, N$, solve the following problem:

-   When you choose $K$ elements from $A$ that include $A_i$, find the maximum possible GCD (greatest common divisor) of those chosen elements.
